I’m a rising senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics 
and Studio Art. I have hands-on experience in object-oriented programming, web design, 
and mathematics, and a strong passion for computer science research — particularly where 
it intersects with math, such as AI/LLMs, quantum computing, and cryptography. I’m also 
deeply interested in user-centered design, which aligns with my art background, and have 
practical experience using digital design tools. Currently, I’m a Data Science Fellow 
expanding my skills in data analysis and visualization — blending my passions for computer 
science, math, and art to create insightful and impactful projects.
